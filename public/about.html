<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm Aswathy (she/her, pronounced Ash-va-thee). I'm based out of Seattle, Washington, and am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Information Management at the University of Washington, Seattle.</p>
<p> I have worked as a Product Manager at Axis Bank ltd, India's 3rd largest private bank, for 3 years, and also as a Business Analyst in a few early stage high-growth Indian start-ups. I'm passionate about leveraging data to build impactful and inclusive tech solutions that make people's lives easier. </p>
<p>In my spare time, I love to read, listen to music and a (somewhat unhealthy) number of true crime podcasts. </p>
